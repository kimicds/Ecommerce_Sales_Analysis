**E-Commerce Order & Revenue Analytics for Business Growth**
***Project Overview***
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of e-commerce transactional data aimed at helping businesses decode complex sales patterns and operational inefficiencies. By transforming raw order data into actionable intelligence, this study provides a roadmap for enhancing profitability through data-driven decision-making. The scope of work encompasses exploratory data analysis, revenue and refund evaluation, and a deep dive into how discount strategies influence customer behavior.

Project Objectives
The primary goal is to evaluate sales and revenue trends over a specific temporal range while identifying the product categories that drive the most value. Beyond simple sales tracking, the project seeks to analyze the financial impact of cancellations and refunds to mitigate revenue loss. Ultimately, the findings are designed to support executive-level decisions regarding pricing models, discount thresholds, and inventory management.

Dataset Description
The analysis is performed on a dataset containing 3,000 transactional records. Each record includes critical features such as Order ID and Customer ID for tracking, Product Category and Order Value for financial assessment, and Discount Applied to measure promotional impact. Furthermore, the data captures Payment Methods, Order Dates, Regional locations, and the final Order Status—categorized as Completed, Cancelled, or Refunded.

Analytical Workflow
The project follows a rigorous data science pipeline beginning with extensive data cleaning, validation, and regional median imputation for missing values. This is followed by an exploratory phase focusing on sales trends and product performance. The core of the analysis involves a segmented assessment of refund behaviors and the correlation between applied discounts and revenue leakage. Finally, temporal trends are mapped to identify peak purchasing windows, supplemented by a regional performance audit.

Project Deliverables
The repository includes a fully cleaned and preprocessed version of the dataset ready for modeling. It features a detailed Jupyter Notebook containing the end-to-end Python code, accompanied by a suite of high-impact visualizations and charts. The final output is a structured business insights report that provides specific, data-backed recommendations for discount optimization and risk control.

Tools and Technologies
The technical stack utilized for this project is centered on the Python data science ecosystem. Pandas and NumPy were employed for robust data manipulation and numerical operations. For data visualization, Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to create intuitive graphical representations of the findings. The entire analysis was documented and executed within the Jupyter Notebook environment.

Primary Business Insights
The investigation revealed that while certain categories like Home and Beauty drive strong completed-order revenue, categories such as Fashion contribute disproportionately to financial losses through high refund rates. It was also determined that discounts act as a volume driver but simultaneously elevate the risk of revenue leakage. Additionally, the data showed significant variance in profitability across different payment methods and regions, with a clear concentration of customer activity during weekdays.
